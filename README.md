# Corne LPTM Case

Low profile tented modular case for the
[Corne-chocolate keyboard](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd).
The 10 degree tents attach using magnets.  A bento-style box secures
the keyboard for carrying.  The two keyboard halves fit together at
the bottom magnetically, with holes providing room for the opposite bumpers.
The tent also has magnets on the front face to attach the palm rest.
